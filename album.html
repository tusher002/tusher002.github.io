          <h5 class="mb-5 text-dark"><strong> On this journey I have visited 4 national parks, 2 states and 2 countries. This sounds a lot, right?
			Ok, I will discuss more.<br>
			I along with my 4 friends made this journey. We started from Tallahassee, then drove to Rahat's place in Orlando. Rahat made some delicious dishes for us.
			After the late night dinner went to airport and dropped our rental car. We flew from Orlando Internation Airport (MCO) to San Antonio International Airport (SAT).
			It was a 3-hours flight. After reaching to San Antonio, we got freshen up, picked up another prebooked rental car, it was a 2022 Toyota hybrid Camry (I loved this car beacause of its fuel economy).
			Had our breakfast at McDonalds then did some shoppting in Walmart (some ready foods, as we all knew we are not going to have our lunch for upcoming few days)
			Had a morning coffee from Panera Bread and finally headed to Carlsbad, New Mexico to our hotel for that night. The journey was almost 8 hours by not hectic at all.
			All thanks goes to the beautiful mountain desert road. We had our buffet dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Carlsbad.<br>
			After a 8-hours fresh sleep, we were ready to finally start our true tour. Left our hotel, had the breakfast and went to
			<a href="https://www.nps.gov/cave/index.htm" >Carlsbad Caverns National Park</a> visitor Center. Reservation is required to enter to the cave.
			We had already made our reservation for self-guided tour from <a href='https://www.recreation.gov/ticket/234637/ticket/10086811'>recreation.gov</a>.
			Another options was directly making the reservation at the visitor center. I prefer the first one. At first I put seal and 
			stamp on my National Parks Passport then took a lift which took us to 750 feet under the earth surface.
			And what I see from then was truly beyond my imaginationtaion. It was feeling like I entered into a different world so unknown to me. It was cold (around 53 degree ferenheit), dark, and silent.
			There were some artificial light sources at different places highlighting remarkable stalagmite shapes, rocks, explanatory boards, directions etc.
			I have seen some stalagmites' formation like Lion's Tail, popcorn-like stalagmites forming dense forest of Fairyland, the bottomless Pit, 
			Silent Bell (largest active stalagmite in the cave). 
			Got to know about the forming procedure (drip by drip) of stalagmites. Finally reached the Big Room, single largest cave chamber in the North America.
			Got to about the history, evolution, spirit world,  mankind's exploratory movements of this cave system. Ok ok ok, I will not give anymore spoiler of this magnificent place.
			Go directly to witness this wholesome creature.<br>
			N.B. There is no mobile network coverage. There is one ranger guided adventurous tour also, who love adventure do not forget to do this. Unfortunately, I did not know about this.
			<br>
			<br>
			Then we headed to White Sands National Park to catch sunset. On the road we saw a beautiful creek flowing through the lush green forest and came to know that the
				forest's name was <a href='https://www.fs.usda.gov/lincoln'>Lincoln National Forest</a>. After spending some gorgeous moments over there we again
				started our journey towards the White Sands. Again we spotted some mind blowing snow topped mountains. We took a break, captured some photos then again 
				boarded on the car. We reached to the visitor center two hours before the sunset. And the first thing I did is obviously putting 
				stamp and seal on the passport. Then went out to explore the park. Oh my my, whatta a stunning natural wonder that was!!
				The dunes of White Sands National Park are among the largest gypsum dunes in the world, and they are unique in their brilliant white color that contrasts beautifully 
				with the surrounding mountains and blue skies. The park offers a variety of activities for visitors to enjoy, such as hiking, camping, picnicking, 
				and even sledding down the dunes. And the sunset it is the most amazing moment you ever could imagine. Black moutains are far away
					in the background and blood like red Sun was setting through them. 
The white sands blown by the wind getting mixed with the red color was giving birth to a heavenly color.

						Redoing the links arrangement. Current thought is it should go:

						UML Alerts <-> GUI I  <-> Racket Weather

						In the future, add DB1 and DB2 projects, and maybe one other project
						to complete the 3rd full row. Possibly College repository. This should
						be possible after graduation. Could also add the DB2 app.

						3rd future row would be:
						DB2 Phase 2 <-> DB2 Android app <-> College

						4th row could be:
						React Tutorial <-> MEAN Project <-> another project

						5th row could be:
						HTML-Apps <-> Teaching <-> iSENSE-API

						In the future, maybe add ECG lab work too (Teaching and API repositories)
